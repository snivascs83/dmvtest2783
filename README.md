### 1. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **yarn** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
yarn install or npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.
